Fits causal models on Kemmeren data set to predict the results of gene knockout experiments.


= files
## prepares kemmeren data for analysis
0-data-setup.R 

## runs models on 0-data-setup.RData
1-fit.R 

## creates *.lsf files and submit them to job scheduler
## the output is then stored in 1-fit_seed.RData where
## * is the name of the model and seed is the seed used for that run
1-lsf.R

## compiles results of model runs (e.g. averages ranks of coefficients)
2-summarize.R



#### USAGE

### EXAMPLE: FAST, MOSTLY FOR TESTING
bash clean ## gets rid of old results
Rscript 0-data-setup.R args_fast.R ## sets up data
Rscript 1-fit.R args_fast.R
Rscript 2-summarize.R
## run 3-*.R to generate plot output / compare performance

### EXAMPLE: FULL RUN ON HPC with JOB SCHEDULER
Rscript 0-data-setup.R args_hpc.R ## sets up data
Rscript 1-lsf.R args_hpc.R ## creates lsf scripts and submits jobs (long time)
Rscript 2-summarize.R
## run 3-*.R to generate plot output / compare performance

### EXAMPLE: TEST LSF FILE GENERATION
Rscript 1-lsf.R args_fast.R ## creates lsf scripts does not submit jobs
